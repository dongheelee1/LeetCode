Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. 
For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one

110. Balanced Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
Example 1:
Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Return true.
Example 2:
Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:
       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4
Return false.

IDEA: 
A balanced binary tree has to fulfill 3 things: 
1. the difference in height of the left and right subtrees must be at most 1 
2. left subtree must be balanced 
3. right subtree must be balanced 
height = longest path (count # of edges) from root to leaf 
isBalanced(root)
    [1] if root is None <-- trivially, the tree is balanced 
    
    [2] calculate height difference between root's left and root's right 
    
    [3] if greater than 1, return False 
    
    [4] otherwise, check that both left and right subtrees are balanced 
    
getHeight(root):     
    an empty tree has 0 height so if this is the case, return 0 
    
    *don't account for tree with 1 node (height = 0) in this problem as isBalanced takes care of it in [2]
    
    otherwise, return 1 + max(getHeight(left), getHeight(right))
